# generic score-calculating helpers and wrappers
# the actual scoring functions can be found in `accuracy.R`, `log_score.R`, etc.

# TODO score() functional (accepts 1 or more forecasts and a scoring function)

# TODO for all additional required arguments in scoring functions, set sane defaults and give a warning if the defaults are used.
# TODO? move forecast_time filtering out of the scoring functions and into a wrapper
