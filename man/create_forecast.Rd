\title{Create a forecast}
\usage{
create_forecast(dat, name = NULL, forecast_time = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Forecast data. Either a data frame or list of data frames.
An ensemble of forecasts can be provided as a list of data frames, in which case it will be aggregated into a single data frame.
The data frame(s) should contain a column named \code{time}, which may be of integers, dates, or date-times.
No mixing of types is allowed (e.g. \code{time} may not contain both integers and date-times).}

\item{name}{A string specifying the name of the forecast/model.}

\item{forecast_time}{An integer, date, or date-time specifying when the forecast was created.
Its type should match the type of values in the \code{time} column(s) of \code{data}
If provided, this forecast will be scored only using data corresponding to dates/times greater than or equal to \code{forecast_time}.
Additionally, graphs of this forecast will highlight the \code{forecast_time} using a vertical line.}
}
\value{
A named list containing the forecast and its metadata
}
\description{
\code{create_forecast()} creates a forecast object given data and optional metadata.
It accepts a variety of forecast formats as input and intelligently converts them into a standardized format.
}
\examples{
# forecast with numeric times and raw data
create_forecast(data.frame(time=1:3, raw=10:12), name="a forecast", forecast_time=2)

# forecast with dates and mean-and-quantiles data
create_forecast(
  data.frame(
    time=c(lubridate::ymd("2024-01-01"), lubridate::ymd("2024-01-02")),
    mean=10:11, quant_2.5=5:6, quant_97.5=15:16), name="another forecast")

# combining an ensemble of realizations into one
create_forecast(list(
  dplyr::tibble(time=1:5,raw=6:10),
  dplyr::tibble(time=2:6,raw=7:11),
  dplyr::tibble(time=3:7,raw=8:12)))

# an already-combined ensemble
create_forecast(dplyr::tibble(time=1:2, raw=list(10:11, 12:13)))
}
